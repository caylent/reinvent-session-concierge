# re:Invent Session Concierge 2023

This project uses Amazon Bedrock Titan text embeddings stored in a postgres database to enable generative AI queries across the re:Invent session data. It combines both semantic search and traditional queries.

## Setup

1. Get the sessions however you want.
2. `finch build . -t reinvent-session:latest`.
3. Deploy to your docker host of choice or run locally.

This readme will be updated with more useful information at a later date.
